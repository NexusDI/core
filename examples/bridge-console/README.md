# Bridge console

The Meridian bridge console: a React Router 8 app in framework mode, rendered
on the server. Its server graph `BridgeConsole` imports `BridgeLink`, which
calls the bridge API (`examples/bridge-api`) over HTTP, and its client graph
`BridgeClient` runs in the browser.

The console's loaders call the bridge API at `BRIDGE_API_URL`, which
defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4211/`. The backend runs on the built
libraries, and the console's build target builds them first:

```sh
npx nx run @nexusdi/bridge-console:build
(cd examples/bridge-api && PORT=4211 node --import tsx src/server.hono.ts) &
npx nx run @nexusdi/bridge-console:dev
```

`npx nx run @nexusdi/bridge-console:e2e` starts both servers itself and
runs the Playwright suite in Chromium.
