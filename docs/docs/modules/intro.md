# Welcome to NexusDI! üéâ

Welcome to NexusDI - a dependency injection library that makes sense! No more wrestling with verbose containers or fighting with type systems. NexusDI is here to make your code cleaner, your tests easier, and your development experience smoother.

## What's This All About?

NexusDI is a powerful, lightweight, and ergonomic dependency injection (DI) container for TypeScript and JavaScript. It helps you organize your code without being overly opinionated about how you do it. Think of it as the Millennium Falcon of DI libraries - it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts.

## Why NexusDI? üöÄ

- **Simple API:** Register and resolve services, values, and modules with a clean, intuitive interface
- **Type-safe:** Built for TypeScript, with full type inference and safety
- **Modular:** Organize your code with modules and dynamic configuration
- **Decorator Support:** Use decorators for services, providers, and injection
- **Testable:** Easily mock or override dependencies for testing

## Quick Start ‚ö°

First, install NexusDI:

```bash
npm install @nexusdi/core reflect-metadata
```

Now, let's create a simple example:

```typescript
import { Nexus, Service, Token } from '@nexusdi/core';

const USER_SERVICE = new Token('UserService');

@Service()
class UserService {
  getUsers() {
    return ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
  }
}

const container = new Nexus();
container.set(USER_SERVICE, UserService);

const userService = container.get(USER_SERVICE);
console.log(userService.getUsers()); // ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

That's it! In just a few lines, you've got a fully functional DI setup. Clean, predictable, and straightforward. May the dependencies be with you!
